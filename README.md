<h2>DSP-1 Covers various Topics <h2>
    - Data set Preparation
    - Types of Values
    - Categorical Class, Nominal, Ordinal, Binary
    - split of data (train & test)
    - After getting the data ask these questions
          -What is the unit of analysis?
          -What are the predictors (features)?
          -What is the target/outcome variable?
          -Where is the data coming from?
          -Internal, external, combined?
          -How much data do you have (i.e., how many rows?)
          -What do to if data is too little or too much?
    -Discover and Visualize
          -Use visualization.
              -Histograms, boxplots, scatter plots
              -Use multiple variables in one plot when possible
          -Observe descriptive statistics.
               -How to interpret mean, median, std.dev, min, max?
          -Observe correlations
                -What is correlation?
           -Reduce variables (if needed) (how?)
     -Data Preparation/ feature engineering
     -Data Transformation
     -Train Models
     -Model Evaluation (Classification/Regression)
